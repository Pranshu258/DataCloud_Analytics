# DataCloud Analytics: AaaS
### Pranshu Gupta & Akash Waghela

### Introduction
DataCloud Analytics will enable you to get insights from your consumer data in order to help you connect with the right customer, personalize every interaction and measure the effectiveness of each engagement.

### Data Analytics as a Service
Analytics as a Service (AaaS) refers to the provision of analytics software and operations through Web-delivered technologies. 

### Scope
The software will be a web service that will be used by businesses to visualize their consumer and product usage data to inform and measure their marketing. We will utilize the live product usage data to build insights and create dashboard for the business user. The dashboard will have rich data visualizations that will prove useful for building new marketing strategies. 

### System Interface
The web service system interface will consist of following components:
* Live Product Usage Data Listener
* Data Aggregator
* Insights Generator
* Data Visualizer 

These components will work together to provide the user with useful data visualizations on the dashboard.

### Implementation Details
We plan to use the following technologies and frameworks to build our software:
* Python/Django for Server side programming
* HTML5, CSS and JavaScript for front end UI
* D3.js for Data Visualization
